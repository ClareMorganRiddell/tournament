# tournament
My final project for the full-stack option  of the Udacity Nano Degree program "Introduction to Programming". 

### *Project Description* : *Tournament Planner*

_In this project, youâ€™ll be writing a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament._

_The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible._

_This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing the code that will use it._

## Install
